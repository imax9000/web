# Getting Started

`@skyware/firehose` is a utility library for consuming data from an [AT Protocol Relay](/guides/firehose/glossary#relay).

## Setup

```ts twoslash
import { Firehose } from "@skyware/firehose";

const firehose = new Firehose();
```

The `Firehose` class takes two optional parameters.

- The first is the URL of the Relay to connect to. This defaults to `wss://bsky.network`, the Relay run by Bluesky.
- The second is an `options` object, which lets you provide:
- `cursor`: The cursor to start listening from. A cursor is included in every event emitted by the Relay. If you don't provide a cursor, the Firehose will start listening from the most recent event.
- `setCursorInterval`: By default, the Firehose class will keep track of the latest cursor under thr `cursor` property every 5 seconds. This allows you to save the cursor or resume from that point in case of an error. You can change this interval by providing a number of milliseconds.

## Handling events

```ts twoslash
declare const firehose: import("@skyware/firehose").Firehose;
// ---cut---
firehose.on("commit", (message) => {
	for (const op of message.ops) {
		const uri = "at://" + message.repo + "/" + op.path;
		console.log("URI:", uri);
	}
});
```

A Relay listens for changes to user [repositories](/guides/firehose/glossary#repository) and emits events when changes occur. You can listen for these events by calling the `on` method with a callback. Full documentation on the data you will receive with each event can be found in the <Reference to="/docs/firehose/classes/Firehose#on" /> method documentation.

The most common event you will receive is a `commit` event, which represents a commit to a user's repository, similar to a Git commit.

A commit may contain one or more operations, representing changes to the repository. Each operation contains an action and a path. The action can be one of `create`, `update`, or `delete`. The path is the path to the record affected (e.g. `app.bsky.feed.post/3jvz2442yt32g`).

If the operation is `create` or `update`, it will also contain the following properties:

- `cid`: The [CID](/guides/firehose/glossary#cid) of the created or updated record.
- `record`: The record itself.

## Event Reference

The `Firehose` class may emit the following events:
