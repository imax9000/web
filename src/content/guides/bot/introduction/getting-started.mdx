# Getting Started

`@skyware/bot` makes it easy to build bots for Bluesky. This guide will walk you through logging in and making your first post.

## Setting up

Note that you will need an existing [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) account for the bot to log in to.

Once you have created an account and taken note of your credentials, it's recommended to store them in a `.env` file in the root of your project. You can use the [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to load these credentials into your project.

```env
BSKY_USERNAME=user.bsky.social
BSKY_PASSWORD=your-password
```

## Logging in

To log in,

```ts twoslash
if (!process.env.BSKY_USERNAME || !process.env.BSKY_PASSWORD) throw "";
// ---cut---
import { Bot } from "@skyware/bot";

const bot = new Bot();
await bot.login({
	identifier: process.env.BSKY_USERNAME,
	password: process.env.BSKY_PASSWORD,
});
```

## Posting

Making a post is just as simple.

```ts twoslash
declare const bot: import("@skyware/bot").Bot;
// ---cut---
const post = await bot.post({
	text: "hello, sky!"
});
console.log(post.uri);
```

Refer to the <HighlightText kind={HighlightKind.Method} as="a" href="/docs/bot/classes/Bot#post" className="no-underline">Bot#post</HighlightText> method documentation for more information on the available options.

If the post is successful, you should see its URI logged to your console.

You may notice that the URI begins with `at://`. This is an AT URI, used by [AT Protocol](/guides/bot/glossary#at-protocol-atproto-atp) applications to refer to data, such as posts, follows, and lists. More on this in the [glossary](/guides/bot/glossary#at-uri)!
