# Embeds and Images

Text posts are great, but you can do better. This guide will walk you through embedding posts, images, and links in your posts.

## Embedding posts

Or, more generally, embedding a link to a record in your post. This can be a quote post or an embedded link to a feed generator or list.

You can use the <Reference to="/docs/bot/types/PostPayload#quoted">quoted</Reference> property when creating a post to pass in a reference to the record you would like to quote. This can be an class instance, or any object with a `uri` and `cid`.

```ts twoslash
declare const bot: import("@skyware/bot").Bot;
// ---cut---
const post = await bot.getPost(
  "at://did:plc:ragtjsm2j2vknwkz3zp4oxrd/app.bsky.feed.post/3jvz2442yt32g"
);

await bot.post({
  text: "Check out this post!",
  quoted: post,
});
```

## Embedding images

You can embed up to 4 images in a post using the <Reference to="/docs/bot/types/PostPayload#images">images</Reference> property.

```ts twoslash
declare const bot: import("@skyware/bot").Bot;
// ---cut---
await bot.post({
	text: "Check out this image!",
	images: [
		{
			data: "https://http.cat/images/418.jpg",
			alt: "A cat in a teapot, with the caption '418 I'm a teapot'",
		},
	],
});
```

![A post by @skyware.js.org reading "Check out this image!". The post contains an image of a cat in a teapot, with the caption "418 I'm a teapot".](/img/embeds/image-post.png)

## Embedding external links

Moving on to embedding external links in your posts. The <Reference to="/docs/bot/types/PostPayload#external">external</Reference> property allows you to specify a link or object to embed in your post.

```ts twoslash
declare const bot: import("@skyware/bot").Bot;
// ---cut---
await bot.post({
    text: "Check out this link!",
    external: "https://skyware.js.org"
});
```

![A post by @skyware.js.org reading "Check out this link!". The post contains an embedded link with a title, description, and preview image.](/img/embeds/external-embed.png)

That's it! You can also combine the `quoted` and `images` property to embed both a post and images in your post, but an external link will override any other embeds. Go on and spice up your posts!
