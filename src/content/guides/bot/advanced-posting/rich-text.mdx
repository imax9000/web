# Rich Text

By default, when you create a post, `@skyware/bot` parses your post's text to identify any mentions, hashtags, and URLs. However, in some cases, you may want more control over how a post is displayed. The <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/RichText" /> class provides a convenient interface for constructing a post containing rich text.

## Usage

To start, import the `RichText` class from `@skyware/bot`:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText } from "@skyware/bot";
```

You can then build a rich text string as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .text("Hey, check out this library: ")
    .link("https://skyware.js.org")
    .text("! ")
    .tag("#atdev");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

You'll notice that the `Bot#post` method can accept either `RichText` or a string. Your post will look something like:

![A post by user @skyware.js.org with the text "Hey, check out this library: skyware.js.org! #atdev". The link and the hashtag are highlighted blue.](/img/rich-text/rt-basic.png)

## Mentions

When you're manually constructing `RichText`, mentioning a user requires you to know the user's handle and DID. You can then use the `mention` method to add a mention to your post:

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .text("Hey, ")
    .mention("@skyware.js.org", "did:plc:ith6w2xyj2qy3rcvmlsem6fz")
    .text("!");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

Note that the DID provided *could* differ from the mentioned handle â€” a mention is really just a hyperlink! Use this power for good.

## Hyperlinks

Speaking of hyperlinks, mentions aren't the only way to have text act as a link. The `.link` method we previously used can also take two parameters: text and a URL.

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const richText = new RichText()
    .text("Hey, check out ")
    .link("Skyware", "https://skyware.js.org")
    .text("!");

await bot.post({ text: richText })
```

![A post by user @skyware.js.org with the text "Hey, check out Skyware!". The word "Skyware" is highlighted blue.](/img/rich-text/rt-hyperlink.png)

## Detecting facets yourself

Alternatively, the `RichText` class contains a <Reference to="/docs/bot/classes/RichText#detectFacets">detectFacets</Reference> static method that will handle detecting all mentions, links, and tags, and automatically resolve mentions to DIDs.

The `post` method and others such as `reply` and `quote` will automatically detect facets for you if you pass a string. However, if you want to detect facets from an existing string but exclude certain facets, the `RichText.detectFacets` method offers greater control.

```ts twoslash
import { RichText, Bot } from "@skyware/bot";
declare const bot: Bot;
// ---cut---
const text = "Hey, @skyware.js.org! #atdev";
const facets = await RichText.detectFacets(text, bot);

await bot.post({ text, facets });
```

You must pass your `bot` instance in to `RichText.detectFacets` so that it can resolve mentions. If you pass `facets` into `post`, only those facets will be used.

## Moving on

You may notice that adding a link to a post doesn't automatically add an embedded preview. Learn more about that in [Embeds and Images](/guides/bot/advanced-posting/embeds-and-images)!
